# Geolocator
Mobile phone app that geo-locates scanned physical maps to enable sattelite-assisted navigation 
This will be useful for, e.g:
 - Hikers that walk in an area where a map is available in a paper brochure, and want to use a GPS navigator showing their location on this map.
 - Orienteering runners who wish to analyze their actual route using the delivered paper map.
